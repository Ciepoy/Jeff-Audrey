            <p id="container2">The Lumpiang Togue</p>
            <p id="description">Lumpiang Togue is a variation of the spring roll. Instead of meat, Mung bean sprouts (locally known as togue) are used as the major ingredient. This dish is a popular appetizer and snack in the Philippines and it is best eaten when dipped in spicy vinegar with onions and whole peppercorn.</p>

            <p id="container2">The Fresh Lumpia</p>
            <p id="description">Fresh Lumpia is also made with stir-fried vegetables, mostly cabbage, wrapped in a lumpia wrapper and topped with sauce. The main proteins for fresh lumpia are pork and shrimp but rather than hoisin sauce, a mildly sweet, boldly flavored sauce, fresh lumpia sauce is mostly sweet with garlic notes.</p>

        <h1>How to Make Lumpia:</h1>
        <h2>Make the filling</h2><li>Cook the pork until crumbly and set aside. Drain most (but not all) of the grease. Cook the onion and garlic in the remaining grease. Return the pork to the pan and stir in the veggies, cilantro, and seasonings. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
        <h2>Assemble the lumpia</h2><li>Place three tablespoons of the filling on the wrapper and follow the instructions to roll and seal the lumpia. Repeat until all the rolls are assembled.</li>
        <h2>Fry the lumpia</h2><li>Heat oil in a skillet. Fry the lumpia three to four rolls at a time. Turn until all sides are brown. Drain on a paper towel.</li>
